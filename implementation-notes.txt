## IMPLEMENTATION SUMMARY

Features Completed
- All TODOs implemented
- Reels now spin horizontally with smooth logic
- Sound player built using howler.js
- Win logic triggers with 30 percent chance

Code Quality
- Refactored into clean, modular TypeScript
- Used object-oriented design, structured game logic in separate classes

Testing
- Unit tests for Reel and SlotMachine using Jest
- Cypress end-to-end tests for canvas rendering, spin trigger, and win indication
- Page Object Model used in Cypress tests for better maintainability

Continuous Integration
- GitHub Actions CI configured
- Tests run automatically on each push to the main branch

Additional Details
- Spine win animation integrated and conditionally shown
- Game canvas renders with PIXI.js

Test Automation Approach

To demonstrate test automation skills and provide broad coverage, the project includes both unit and end-to-end (E2E) tests.

Frameworks used:
- Jest for unit testing
- Cypress for end-to-end testing

Unit tests target internal logic such as reel spinning and slot machine state handling.
End-to-end tests simulate user behavior including triggering spins, verifying canvas rendering, and checking for win conditions.

Test structure:
- Organized into tests/Unit and tests/cypress/e2e
- Page Object Model applied in Cypress tests for maintainability, reusability and scalability

CI Integration:
- GitHub Actions runs all tests automatically on each commit to main

How to run tests locally:
npm install         # Install dependencies
npm test            # Run Jest unit tests
npx cypress open    # Launch Cypress test runner
